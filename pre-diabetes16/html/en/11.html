                    <hr class="special mb-5">
					<p>If slip ups are not kept in check, a person may begin to relapse. Relapse occurs when you return to practicing older habits like overeating and not being active regularly. Relapses occur over time and the best way to prevent them is to address each slip up fully as they happen. A sign that you have relapsed is when you start to gain weight. </p>
					<p>Letâ€™s see what it would look like if Leila relapsed and gained weight. The process of relapsing looks something like this:</p>
					<ol type="1">
						<li><strong>Leila enters a high-risk situation.</strong>She attends a wedding late at night. All Leila ate that day was a small snack so that she could eat at the wedding. When she arrives, Leila is very hungry and is tempted by the salted nuts, chocolates, cakes, and other sweets. Leila is too hungry to wait for the main entrees, so she ends up indulging in the salted nuts and sweets being offered. </li>
						<li><strong>Leila has no plan for how to cope.</strong>Leila did not bring a healthy snack with her, so she cannot satisfy her hunger with something healthy and is left with only unhealthy options.</li>
						<li><strong>Slip-up happens.</strong>Leila begins to indulge in the chocolates offered to her.</li>
						<li><strong>Negative thinking takes over and there is no plan to move forward.</strong>Leila comes home from the wedding feeling enormous guilt. She feels like she has ruined all the progress she has made with this one meal. </li>
						<li><strong>Another slip-up happens and there is no plan for come back.</strong>Leila goes to work the next day and finds everyone snacking on cupcakes that one of her colleagues handmade. Her office is always surrounded by sweets that people bring in or keep around the office. </li>
						<li>Leila sleeps late and wakes up late, has to rush to get her children to school. She misses breakfast and stops by for coffee. She sees other pastries that look tempting, so she orders a cheese fatayer and chocolate croissant. </li>
						<li><strong>Full relapse.</strong>Leila has continued to eat unhealthily, thinking that she will eventually stop, but still continues. A few weeks later, she is 5 pounds heavier. </li>
